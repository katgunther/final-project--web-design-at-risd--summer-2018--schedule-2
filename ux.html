       <h2>UX-Design</h2>
       <p>
       While I interned at a company called, Globoforce, I was assigned a project to create a regocnition program for restaurants. The reason for the project was to open the company up to the hospitality industry by implementing their regocnition program within restaurants. My design allowed customers to write a review for their waiter, tell them their best characteristics, add a tip, and review their total bill. To get to the final design I did user interviews, affinity mapping, continuums, design, and usability testing.
