       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
       My name is Caoimhe Mosley. I am a student at Stonehill College. I am double majoring in Graphic Design and Marketing. I hope to persue a career in UX design. I was born in Dublin, Ireland, and moved to the United States when I was 10 years old. My favorite things to do are art, hiking, and spending time with family.
