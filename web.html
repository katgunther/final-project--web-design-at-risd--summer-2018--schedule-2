       <h2>Website Design</h2>
       <p>
       These are two assignments from the website design class I took at Rhode Island School of Design. The first project was to create a website for an album, describing the album, the songs, and the composers. The second project was to create a website for Dieter Rams, Ten Principals of Good Design. In this design I used a simple black and white theme, with a pop of red. I had the picture and navagation stay constant, while the rules could either scroll or be clicked on by the navigation.
