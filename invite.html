       <h2>Invitation Design</h2>
       <p>
       These are two invitations I designed. The first invitation is one I created during my internship with Globoforce. It was an invitation for their company annual outing. This was sent out by email to every employee in the company. The second design was for a class. The project was to design an invitation for Boston Design Week. I used icons to represent the different art catagories and wrote out the specific events on that day.
