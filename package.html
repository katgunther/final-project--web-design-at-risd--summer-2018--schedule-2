       <h2>Package Design</h2>
       <p>
       These are all package designs from my package design class at Stonehill College. These are examples of three of the projects that I did in this class. The first project was to redesign a local stores bag packaging. The store I chose to redesign was BeDazzled. The second project was to create a wine label for a local winery. Finally, the third project was to design a tea box.
